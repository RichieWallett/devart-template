## Description
A voice controlled entertainment suite of custom sounds & shapes. A voice triggers 'Ok Google' to find a song to sing. The Visual Vocoder takes the MIDI data and sync's it with assets from a library of unique instrument sounds and graphical shapes. Each attach themselves to the object, your voice (created with a blend MAX MSP, Javascript and fuzzy pixels). 

Adjust your timbre, pitch, volume to change the shape's form and character. Adding another voice, adds new shapes as they begin to morph and dance together. When harmonies align, new *special shapes are formed. Winners share these tracks via SoundCloud & Twitter.

Make sweet or sour music together.
