## Description
A voice controlled entertainment suite of custom sounds & shapes. Your voice triggers 'Ok Google' to find a song to sing. The Visual Vocoder takes the MIDI data and sync's from a library of unique instrument sounds and graphical shapes, then attaches each to an object that is your voice (created with a blend MAX MSP and Javascript). 

Adjust your timbre, pitch, volume to change the shape's form and character. Adding another voice, adds a new shape and they begin to morph together. When harmonies align, new *special shapes are formed. Winners share these tracks via SoundCloud & Twitter.

Make sweet or sour music together.
